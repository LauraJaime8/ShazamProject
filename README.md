# Project of a Shazam 

## Target
The purpose of this work is to carry out an implementation simplified version of Shazam algorithm that is completely functional.

The code must be able:
* Allow to add new songs to a song repository takes capturing the sound with the microphone of the computer and extracting and storing it's acoustic fingerprint.
* Allow matching between a song fragment captured with the microphone and the repository, extracting its acoustic fingerprint and comparing it with those of the repository, to identify which song it is.
